# NetGent
NetGent (Network Agent) is a functional api to design multi agent graph systems. It's inspired on langgraph/langchain &amp; keras/pytorch functional api. The main goal of NetGent is to facilitate to developers the creation of multi agent systems and to add intermediate steps in the most easiest way possible.

NetGent combines the power of generative AI (LLms, VLms, Audio models, vector databases) and the traditional powerful capabilities of neural networks (pretrained conv nets as ResNet, AlexNet, etc...). 

Now, with NetGent, developers can crean an entire AI Ecosystem without too much effort.

Roadmap:

  1) Develop NetGent Core with Gen AI.
  2) Add new features like pytorch compatibility to invoke foundational models.
  3) Migrate code to low level (zig/c) systems.
  4) Enjoy the
