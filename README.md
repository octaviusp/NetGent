# NetGent
NetGent (Network Agent) is a functional api to design multi agent graph systems. It's inspired on langgraph/langchain &amp; keras/pytorch functional api. The main goal of NetGent is to facilitate to developers the creation of multi agent systems and to add intermediate steps in the most easiest way possible.
